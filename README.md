# GoAI

This past academic year I completed Machine Learning and Computer Vision courses at the University of Michigan. These led me to become interested in Artificial Intelligence, which will be another class I take in the upcoming fall. However until then I've decided to work on a project for my own curiosity, a bot that can play Go. 

This AI will be written in Python, and in later stages of the project will be deployed to AWS so that I can test it against other players and AI's.
